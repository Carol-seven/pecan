Description: A portfolio of tools for economic complexity analysis and
    industrial upgrading navigation. The package implements essential measures
    in international trade and development economics, including the relative
    comparative advantage (RCA), economic complexity index (ECI) and product
    complexity index (PCI). It enables users to analyze export structures,
    explore product relatedness, and identify potential upgrading paths grounded
    in economic theory, following the framework in Hausmann et al. (2014)
